# UI-FOR-CLOSESTPAIR2D-INTEGER-MULTIPLICATION
This project implements Divide and Conquer algorithms: (i) Closest Pair of Points, (ii) Integer Multiplication. It generates 20 random input datasets (10 per problem, size >100), processes them, and visualizes results through an interactive React-based UI for file selection and execution.
